Project 1 of Full Stack Nanodegree from Udacity. 

This is Project 1 of the Udacity Nanodegree for Full Stack Developer.

To run the project, use the following:

    python main.py

This will open a web browser with a list of some of my favorite movies. Clicking on the image of the movie will show a trailer, and clicking on the title will take you to the imdb page.
